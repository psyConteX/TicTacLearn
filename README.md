# TicTacLearn
an upload of all the test stuff i changed/wrote, some things may be copied from othert people just to so i can understand and test them
this is also mostly a test to understand git and github

test2 is a tictactoe game
hellofriends is a sort of adressbook with multiple input variants includes a option to save/load over c++terminal, only on stack, nothin on heap so large datasets would crash, well at least thats what i assume
rewrite helloworld1 is nothing i rewrote its copy of something to test stuff
NewDataBook is a try to rewrite hellofriends a bit cleaner, im still learning alot of stuff so its mostly badly written, also due to learning different stuff im not really doing anything here right now
marcus.py is a copy from someone, pong is also copied but i implemented the "powerup", tests_1 dotzer test.py is copied to learn and test,
